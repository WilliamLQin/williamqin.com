## Discovering Android
Recently, I got myself a new Android phone! After using an outdated iPhone 5s for 2 years, it feels great to get access to the latest smartphone features. I now have dual cameras, longer battery life, a faster processor, NFC (Near-Field Communication), and a much bigger screen.

Awesome new technology aside, what's really important isÂ that I can now begin developing for Android and be a part of the Google ecosystem. Instead of having to learn Swift to develop for iOS, I can now use Java, which I know much better, and development environments that are on Windows.

In the past few days, I have been learning how to use Android Studio to create my own applications on my phone. While not particularly groundbreaking, I can get user input, save files, and access the camera!

On a semi-related note, machine learning has always been a particular area of interest for me. With my new Android phone, I decided to finally commit myself to learning how to use the power of machine learning in a mobile app. Rather than learn the math and calculus behind how the complex nodes in a neural network can be used to analyze patterns, I will utilize open source libraries to apply machine learning to solving practical problems. For example, I know that I can use OpenCV to track the location of an object with the camera footage from a mobile device (I haven't actually done it yet though).

I have some very interesting ideas that will require machine learning and that I would like to implement on Android, and I hope that I will be able to bring them to life by my next blog post!
