## Hello World!

<br>

##### 8 March 2018 Edit:

My blog is now directly found on my personal website! This website still uses Jekyll and is hosted in an Amazon Web Services S3 bucket.

##### 6 Jan 2018 Edit:

My blog is no longer built in this fashion! I now use Jekyll to generate my static website and host it in an Amazon Web Services S3 bucket.

##### Original Post:
My personal website is now also built with Angular, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Bootstrap, and hosted in an AWS S3 bucket as well.

This is my first blog post on The Thinking Rock! 
I will be using this blog as a platform for me to share my what's going on in my ongoing exploration of the world around me.

Fun fact: the name "The Thinking Rock" comes from the literal interpretation of what computers are. A computer's CPU is made from silicon, which is found in sand. A computer also processes instructions and does calculations, which in essence, is a form of thinking.

Creating my blog was a fairly simple task. Contrary to my personal website [williamqin.com](http://williamqin.com){:target="_blank"}, which was built only from lines of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, I made The Thinking Rock using WordPress.

To get setup, all I had to do was install WordPress on this blog, add the necessary plugins, customize the appearance to my liking, and I was ready to add content!

Overall, the experience in using WordPress was very enjoyable and much simpler than using only code, but I did feel like I lost a bit of control over the more nuanced things like the exact placement of elements.

I look forward to being able to share my projects and ideas through my blog!
