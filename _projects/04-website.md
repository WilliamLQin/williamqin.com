# Personal Website

This website has evolved several times over the past few years!

I created my website at williamqin.com in December 2016, right after my first hackathon! I had a free domain name that I was ready to use.

Then, just a year later, I did a complete redesign of my website in December 2017, employing my Illustrator and Angular skills to create a hexagonal design! Unfortunately, this carried even more problems from the last version, including slow responsiveness and mobile unfriendly design.

Finally, in March 2017, I did another redesign and we are at the current version of the website today!
