Laser Field is a laser bounding and survival mobile game!  
It runs as an iOS application.  
"Dodge lasers in this new and amazing bounding game!"  

The project was created in Xcode and programmed in Objective-C.  

Laser Field was my very first programming project that I launched on the iOS App Store!  
It was downloaded over 150 times, and made over 350 ad impressions!  

Unfortunately, Laser Field can't be found on the App Store anymore.
