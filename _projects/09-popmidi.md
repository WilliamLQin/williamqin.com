Pop MIDI is a pop can music box that can play MIDI files!  
The hardware creation is to be used with a Python script and an ArduinoC script. 

"This instrument brings a new sense of fun and uniqueness with its cool resonating sound and eco-friendly nature!"  

Hardware consists of an Arduino, several servos, pop cans, stirring sticks, duct tape, and cardboard boxes.  
The hardware was programmed in ArduinoC and the MIDI file reader was programmed in Python.  

Pop MIDI was created at Cipher Local Hack Day, a 12-hour hackathon in Brampton. 

Our team won 1<sup>st</sup> Place with a Mentor!
