# Space Jousting

![Space Jousting](/assets/img/spacejousting1-min.jpg){: .image-right .image-6}

Space Jousting is an action-packed two-player game where you try to strike your opponent at their weak spots!  
It runs as a standalone application on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.  

The project was created in Unity and programmed in C#.  

Space Jousting was created at Cipher Snowday '17, a 12-hour hackathon in Brampton.  
It was my first time mentoring for a team, and our team won 2<sup>nd</sup> Place!
