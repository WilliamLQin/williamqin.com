Think Tank is a game that uses your brain waves to control a tank!  
It runs as a standalone application on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux, and is to be used with the Muse Headband and SDK.  
"Train your concentration and lose yourself in this immersive telepathic co-op tank game!"  

The project was built in Unity and programmed in C#.

Think Tank was created at Electric City Hacks 2, a 36-hour hackathon at Trent University.  
Our team won Top 6 Overall Hack, Best Domain Name, and the Wolfram One Award! <br>
