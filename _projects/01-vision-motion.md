Vision Motion is a motion sensor mobile app that uses the camera to track an object and graph position, velocity, and acceleration.  
It runs as an Android application.  
"Track and graph the motion of anything."  

The project was built in Android Studio and programmed in Java.

Vision Motion was originally created at THacks2, a 24-hour hackathon at the University of Toronto.  
Later, I continued working on the project and published it on the Google Play Store!  
It has been used in physics classrooms to enhance learning!
