Lightboard Creator is an interface for creating lightboard messages to be displayed on traffic signs!  
It runs as a standalone application on Windows.  

The project was created in Visuasl Studio and programmed in C#.  

Lightboard Creator was one of the major projects that I worked on as a software developer intern at D&amp;R Electronics Co. Ltd.  
It is now being used to rapidly create and deploy various messages for the company's lightboards.
