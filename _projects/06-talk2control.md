Talk 2 Control is a web application that controls your screen using voice recognition!  
The project is deployed as a Linux server at http://talk2control.tech.  
"Control your slides with Talk 2 Control magic!"  

The project was built with Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and deployed on Digital Ocean.

Talk 2 Control was created at Local Hack Day at Shopify Toronto, a 12-hour hackathon at the Shopify HQ.
