Fihgt is a local two player fighting game with a variety of characters!  
It runs as a standalone application on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.  
"A wacky and fun fighting game for two players!"  

The project was created in Unity and programmed in C#, and assets were created using AESprite.  

Fihgt was a short side project that was started with a friend during the winter break.  
We are now working on a new project with a bigger scope: [Plant](/projects/plant)!
