Stux is an engaging and minimalist stacking game!  
It runs as an iOS application.  
"Balance blocks in this new and incredible arcade stacker!"  

The project was created in Xcode and programmed in Objective-C.  

Stux was my second programming project that I launched on the iOS App Store!  
It was downloaded over 300 times, and made over 1500 ad impressions!  

Unfortunately, Stux can't be found on the App Store anymore.
