# Hi, I'm William Qin
  
I am a student, developer, and creator! Right now, I am studying software engineering at the University of Waterloo and experimenting with new technologies to learn new skills as I pursue my passion for technology and creation. I love to learn, take opportunities to grow, and tackle difficult problems whenever possible.

Currently, I use and work with many different programming languages and tools! So far, I have...

* ...made [games](/projects/fihgt) in Unity with C#
* ...used your [brain waves](/projects/thinktank) from a Muse headband to play a game in Unity
* ...created websites (like this one!) and [web applications](/projects/talk2control) using a combination of web tools
* ...developed [Android applications](/projects/visionmotion) in Android Studio with Java
* ...tracked objects with [computer vision](/projects/magnet) (OpenCV)
* ...programmed [autonomous robots](/projects/robotics) in Eclipse with Java
* ...created [virtual reality experiences](/projects/cprvr) using Google Cardboard
* ...made [smart devices](/projects/discoalarm) (IoT) with Arduino/Raspberry Pi, Python, and AWS
* ...flown [autonomous drones](/projects/projectbrett) to survey areas with C/C++
