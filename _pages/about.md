# Hi, I'm William Qin
  
I am a high school student, developer, and creator! Currently, I am experimenting with new technologies and learning new skills as I pursue my passion for technology and creation. I am always eager to learn new things, take opportunities to grow, and tackle difficult problems.

Since I was 9 years old, I have been applying my programming skills to develop interesting games, create problem solving applications, prototype hardware, and design websites. The very first programming language I learned was ActionScript, a language used in Macromedia Flash (today, it is known as Adobe Animate). My early journey through learning programming languages was a rough and unguided one—I only had examples to learn from—but despite all odds, I made exciting games that I brought to school for my peers and I to play!

Today, I use and work with many different programming languages and tools! So far, I have...

* ...made games in Unity with C#
* ...created websites and web applications using a combination of Jekyll (Ruby), Markdown, Angular, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, Amazon Web Services, TypeScript and JavaScript
* ...developed Android applications in Android Studio with Java
* ...processed data using Python
* ...tracked objects with computer vision and artificial intelligence
* ...programmed robots in Eclipse with Java
* ...created virtual reality experiences using Google Cardboard
* ...made smart (IoT) devices with Arduino
